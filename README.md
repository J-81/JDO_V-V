# V-V Scripts #

### What is this repository for? ###

V-V Scripts for RNASeq raw and processed data processed through the RNASeq consensus
pipeline.

This project will seek to implement two kinds of V-V.  First, one that can be performed
on a standard file directory after processing.  Second, functions that are run as part of
the Nextflow implementation of the RNASeq consensus pipeline.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up

Activate conda environment (Note: this environment is on the oberyn node)
> conda activate rnaseq_v1.0

The following command should kick off the program using parameters appropriate for testing:

### Documentation ###
* Documentation For Top Level Functions

This is located in the docs folder.  Specifically, if you download the docs folder and open the index.html file, you should see the docs as generated by Sphinx. **Note: Along with the rest of the dev branch, these should be considered a work in progress and may not reflect the code exactly (although this is the goal)**
